        * Create a website (from scratch) that asks users if they eat steak.</p>
        <p>* If they respond with "yes", write the following to
        the page: "Here’s a Steak Sandwich!"</p>
        <p>* If they respond with "no", write the following to the page: "Here’s a Tofu Stir-Fry!"</p>
        <br>
        * **BONUS:** Ask what the user’s birth year is. If they are under 21, alert the following: "No Sake for you!"
        <br>
        * **HINT:**
        You will need to use `document.write()` from a few slides back.
